### Class Overview

The `ReactNativeFlipper` class is responsible for initializing and configuring Flipper within a React Native application. Flipper is a powerful debugging tool that provides a suite of plugins for inspecting and debugging your application's state, network traffic, databases, and more. This class provides a debug flavor of Flipper setup, allowing you to customize and extend its functionality.

### Methods

#### initializeFlipper(Context context, ReactInstanceManager reactInstanceManager)

This static method is the entry point for initializing Flipper. It takes the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | `Context` | The application context. |
| `reactInstanceManager` | `ReactInstanceManager` | The React Native instance manager. |

**Functionality:**

1. **Check Flipper Eligibility:** The method first checks if Flipper should be enabled using `FlipperUtils.shouldEnableFlipper(context)`. This method typically checks if the application is running in debug mode and if Flipper is available on the device.
2. **Create Flipper Client:** If Flipper should be enabled, it creates a `FlipperClient` instance using `AndroidFlipperClient.getInstance(context)`.
3. **Add Plugins:** The method then adds the following Flipper plugins to the client:
   - `InspectorFlipperPlugin`: Provides a powerful UI inspector for inspecting the application's view hierarchy and state.
   - `DatabasesFlipperPlugin`: Allows you to inspect and manipulate the application's databases.
   - `SharedPreferencesFlipperPlugin`: Provides access to the application's shared preferences.
   - `CrashReporterPlugin`: Captures and reports crashes within the application.
   - `NetworkFlipperPlugin`: Enables monitoring and inspecting network traffic. This plugin is integrated with the React Native `NetworkingModule` to intercept network requests and display them in Flipper.
   - `FrescoFlipperPlugin`: Provides tools for debugging the Fresco image loading library. This plugin is added after the React Native context is initialized to ensure that Fresco's `ImagePipelineFactory` is ready. 
4. **Start Flipper:** The `client.start()` method starts the Flipper server.

**Special Considerations:**

- The `FrescoFlipperPlugin` is added after the React Native context is initialized to ensure that Fresco's `ImagePipelineFactory` is ready. This is achieved by using `reactInstanceManager.addReactInstanceEventListener()` and running the plugin initialization on the native modules queue thread.
- The `NetworkFlipperPlugin` is integrated with the React Native `NetworkingModule` to intercept network requests. This allows Flipper to monitor and inspect network traffic within your React Native application.
