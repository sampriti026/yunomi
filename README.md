# Yunomi

Yunomi is an AI mobile app which helps find you the right internet friend who is interested in you. When I got into coding during my law school, I would send thousands of cold dms on twitter and discord to find someone of the same mindset. Human beings are mimetic mammals, we mimic the desires of the people we are surrounded by. This app makes it easier to find the right person for you by understanding you through your conversation.

## üîñ Features

- Talk to the bot Nomi, who will understand you with your messages and connect you with someone of your kind. 
- Profile view of other users give you the public conversations they are having with others, which helps in truly understanding someone unlike other performative social network. 
- The Feed gives you the messages of 150 users around the world whose thought you might connect with. A reply to the post directly starts a one-to-one conversation. The number is derived from the "Dunbar Number" which is the ideal number of meaningful relationships that a human being can form.
- You can swipe messages from your own chatboxes to directly post any thoughts you had shared with someone to the world. Conversation makes it easier to express our candid selves, and there is no other social networking platform which makes it possible to connect with someone based on their conversations.
- Send private message to someone only if you like each other. 


## üöß Problem Statement and Approach

 - The project was inspired by lack of platform for people building in public, who needs funds and necessary belief capital to iterate on their product. Additionally, the pitch video or demo video helps in gaining more accurate insight about the product, thus providing useful feedbacks. 

 - The video is updated through Livepeer and reviews are issued as Krebit credential. These credentials help establish indie builders portable reputation to build trust as they launch products or enhance exisiting one, thus establishing a trusted crowdfund. 

 - Further, the app is Sybil resistant as only people with verified Twitter on Krebit are allowed to upvote on products. Upvotes on products help reach more visibility to the indie builders.

 - Crowdfund contract allows user to raise funds by setting a deadline and the goal they seek to achieve from the deadline. Ethers.js is used to fetch the amount raised so far, the amount the user seek to achieve and the deadline by which the crowdfund contract would accept fund raising.
