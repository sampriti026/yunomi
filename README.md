## 🚧 Problem Statement and Approach

 - When I got into coding during my law school, I would send thousands of cold DMS on Twitter and Discord to find someone of the same mindset. Human beings are mimetic mammals, we mimic the desires of the people we are surrounded by. Although the internet has revolutionized connectivity, it often falls short in facilitating genuine interactions. Inspired by our inherent mimetic nature, where we emulate the desires of those around us, this app simplifies the process of finding the right connections through nuanced conversation analysis, eliminating the need for countless cold contacts.
